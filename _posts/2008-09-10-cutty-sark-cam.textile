Our friend (and long-time Helicoid beta tester/software breaker) Simon Starr recently created the "Cutty Sark Cam":http://cuttysarkcam.org.uk/.  The Cutty Sark is a clipper ship built in 1869, and was sadly damaged by a fire in 2007.  You can watch the progress of the extensive restoration using Simon's camera.
