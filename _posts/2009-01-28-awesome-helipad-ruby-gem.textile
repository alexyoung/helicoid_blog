If you want to write software that works with Helipad, there's now an awesome "Helipad gem":http://blog.nyerm.com/2009/01/08/helipad-ruby-interface/ written by Lonnon Foster.  I've checked over the code, and it's clean and well-written.  

You could build a lot of cool stuff with this.  How about a "Shoes":http://shoooes.net/ Helipad app?  Or maybe something with RubyCocoa?  Let us know what you build and we'll give you mad props (and possibly riches).

Here's some example code from Lonnon's library:
