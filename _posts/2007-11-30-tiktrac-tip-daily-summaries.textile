"Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com sheets have several export formats.  To view the export options, click "Export" when viewing a sheet.  A panel opens like this:

Perhaps the most useful way to export sheet data is *Export daily summaries as CSV*.  This creates a file you can easily open with Excel, Open Office or Apple's Numbers, which contains the total duration for each day.  If you're in the *month* view, this will export a duration for each day of the month.

This really helps when submitting time sheets to contractor agencies!  In fact, we implemented this feature specifically for contractors.
