Helipad's just been updated with some new sort features and a load of bug fixes for IE 7 and Opera 9.

You can now choose how to sort your documents by clicking a table column title.  You can also use a drop-down menu, illustrated here:

Sorting was a commonly requested feature, so thanks to everyone who got in touch in with their ideas and suggestions through our "contact form":http://helicoid.net/contact.

Here's the full list of recent changes:

* Stopped IE from warning about saving a new document
* Fixed Opera 9 tag search rendering issue
* Fixed tag colour editor rendering Opera 9
* Added Ajax sort options on the dashboard
* Added pop-up sort menu (intended for use when in "preview" mode
* Added striped tables
