We've just updated Deadline with these fixes/improvements:

* Calendar feeds that don't need HTTP auth are now available for those of you who want to subscribe to Deadline in *Google Calendar*
* Reminders are now switched off/on properly (thanks *debaire*)
* Fixed parsing of phrases like "hunt rabbit 3am tomorrow" (thanks *voamash*)

These issues have been acknowledged but not fixed yet:

* Phrases containing "today" aren't interpreted 100% correctly yet
* Jabber bot isn't working across Google Talk to Jabber.  We're testing our own Jabber server, and it may be that we have to run a service for Google Talk and Jabber separately -- thanks to *dag* for helping us with this

These are things we've been asked about a lot this week:

* We're looking into the costs for SMS alerts and international support
* Time zone support quality is being looked into
* We are indeed building a Mac and iPhone application (Helipad iPhone will be out first)
* If anyone builds a *cool* and user-friendly *Adobe Air application* we'll modestly reward you (possibly serious Amazon/iTunes vouchers, we haven't decided yet)

h3. Tiktrac

Tiktrac has new features tested and ready to go live, we're just waiting for the Deadline press to quiet down before deploying:

* HH:MM display option is coming soon
* Email imports will be going live with the HH:MM update, this will allow you to set up back office applications to email CSV files into Tiktrac
* Interface bug fixes
