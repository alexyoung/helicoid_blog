Big changes are afoot in "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com today.  The whole user management system has been refreshed, so you'll forgive me if I don't sit back and relax with some wine and music after working every possible hour on these features for the last two weeks.

Do you remember that I hinted Tiktrac only had 2 more large updates to go before it goes live?  This collection of improvements constitutes one of them.  This one was fundamental, and overdue -- the user permissions system (the Administrator, Staff, Read only metaphor) was slightly odd and only intended as a placeholder.

Now you can add people to clients with read or write permissions, allowing you greater control over who can post tasks and who can simply view them.

When editing an account, there's now a permissions section:

The People page has also been updated:

In addition to these welcome changes, clicking on a person's name now shows you a page containing what they've been working on recently.

If you're a contractor, this page can be really great for your clients to bookmark.  It affords a clear view of what you've been working on recently, replete with graphs.  I added the graphs purely to make you look good to your clients, so I hope you like them!

The help section has also been refreshed, making it easier to read.  Help content is also more consistent across Tiktrac:
