Julian Romero has kindly written a "Greasemonkey":http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/ script to add stopwatch functionality to "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com.  This allows you to stop and start tasks as you work on them without needing to remember the time you spent.

Check it out here: "http://wiki.mad.mw/GreaseMonkey/UserScripts/TikTracStopWatch":http://wiki.mad.mw/GreaseMonkey/UserScripts/TikTracStopWatch

Greasemonkey is an extension for Firefox that allows developers to modify how websites work.  In this example, Julian has written some JavaScript that adds a stopwatch to each task on your Tiktrac dashboard.

To install this script:

# "Get the Greasemonkey extension":https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/
# "Go to Julian's wiki":http://wiki.mad.mw/GreaseMonkey/UserScripts/TikTracStopWatch
# Right click "TikTracStopWatch.user.js " and select "Install This User Script..."

Now you should see something like this when you're using Tiktrac:

Simply click on "start" to start the timer.  I think you'll agree that this addition is welcome and very useful.  Thanks, Julian!
