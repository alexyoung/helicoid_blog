The "Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com colours update has just gone live!  This update adds:

* Configuration options for colours and background images in *Settings, Appearance*
* Almost all of the colours in Deadline's interface can be controlled: background, buttons, navigation (footer), highlight hover, "odd" rows, search bar border
* A generous helping of our own preset themes to get you started
* Background images can also be uploaded and tiled if required
* We've also added a print stylesheet
* Fixes for date parsing when descriptions contain numbers

The preset themes come from my own designs and photo collection.  Here's the current set:

The *Appearance* settings look like this:
