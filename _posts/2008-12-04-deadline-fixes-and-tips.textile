This week we've made the following fixes to Deadline:

* Google Calendar will now show text instead of just "busy"
* Time zone bugs have been resolved (sometimes typing "tonight" resulted in a date for tomorrow)
* Internet Explorer 6 and Chrome support improved
* Selecting "-------" as a date in the full date entry form returned XML instead of a friendly error

If Google Calendar still says busy for all of your Deadline events:

# Remove the calendar
# Go to Deadline and copy the link to the iCal feed from the Settings page
# Paste in the calendar link, but add "?999" to the end of the link

The reason you need to add ?999 is a random number will fool Google into thinking it's a different URL and thus download the new version instead of using a cached copy.

Your URL should look something like this:
