The _Helicoid Icon Set_ is a collection of icons we use in our applications, including:

* Navigational cues
* Credit card images
* Scalable buttons
* Images to enhance web applications

h3. Why are we giving these icons away for free?

As the lead programmer and designer of Helicoid's applications, I've worked ridiculously hard over the last year at two jobs: programming and design.  Programming software is my passion, but I've had to teach myself design skills in order to get our applications released on a shoestring budget.

I realised there might be a lot of programmers out there in a similar situation (especially open source developers), so these icons are dedicated to you.  If you open them up in Adobe's Illustrator (or try the SVG file with an open source image editor) you'll find it's easy to change colours around and scale the icons.
