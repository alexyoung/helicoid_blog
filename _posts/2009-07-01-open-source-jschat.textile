"JsChat":http://jschat.org/ is an MIT-licensed JSON-based chat system with a nifty web interface:

People have called it an "open source Campfire", but it's not really meant to be a Campfire competitor.  It's actually a response to these questions:

* Can we make a chat system like IRC without the legacy and bloated protocol?
* Can it work naturally on the web, desktop and console?

The "Js" in JsChat refers to JSON rather than JavaScript.  It's very easy to build bots and clients.  For more information, see the "JsChat site":http://jschat.org and "JsChat blog":http://blog.jschat.org.
