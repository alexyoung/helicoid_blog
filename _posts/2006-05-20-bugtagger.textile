We're putting the finishing touches to "Bugtagger":http://www.bugtagger.com, our bug reporting software.  There's still some way to go, but we're already using it to track bugs in our own projects, so there's not long to go now!

h3. Who is it for?

Bugtagger is aimed at developers who want to allow customers to report issues and bugs.

There are several ways to integrate your projects with Bugtagger.

h3. Project integration

You can integrate Bugtagger into your applications through the Bugtagger API, or Bugtagger's bug reporting form.  Each project you add to Bugtagger can have a form, and it gives you a unique and easy to remember URL for each one.

<a href="http://helicoid.bugtagger.com/report/tiktrac">The form looks like this</a>:

As you can see, there is a dynamic slider and tag entry field.  These are designed to help your clients feel less constrained with technical details and able to accurately express what the problem they've found is.

The <strong>Technical notes</strong> field contains text generated by our JavaScript API for client snooping.  At the moment, it gathers this data:

<pre>
resolution: 1280x1024
color_depth: 32
flash_version: 8
flash_installed: Flash and Shockwave
user_agent: Firefox
version: 1.5
OS: Windows XP
css_mode: CSS1Compat
java: Java installed
</pre>

h3. Bug management

Each bug has its own page, which looks like this:

You can post notes and files to bugs to discuss the issue with your clients.  There's also a bug history, which shows all the events that have happened during resolution of the bug.

The notes are updated every thirty seconds, so you could have an almost realtime discussion about a problem with a client, without any other software.

You can also list related bugs.  Bugtagger generates this list based on the tags people have given bugs.

h3. Why tags?

Since we're both software developers, we've worked with many issue-tracking packages over the years.  We've often felt that while many integrate nicely with code or wikis, none provide a means of turning your bugs and issues into a useful repository of information you can use to guide future projects.

We're using tags to allow you to easily spot problems cropping up across projects or over time, so you can turn your bug reports into a valuable body of information.

h3. Why offer an API?

We want you to integrate anything with Bugtagger: web, desktop even mobile applications.  We felt offering an API was the best way to do this.

With a little bit of effort, the Bugtagger API could be used to:

# Integrate your software with Bugtagger, keeping your own branding and look and feel
# Integrate other software you use to run your business with Bugtagger, such as Basecamp, Backpack or Tiktrac
# Search and export your Bugtagger data to be used in reports or specifications

h3. When can I use it?

"Get in touch with us":http://helicoid.net/contact and let us know what you want to use Bugtagger for.  We'll give you an account for free, and let you play with it (and hopefully help us make it even more awesome!)
