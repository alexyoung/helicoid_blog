I've been working on improving the Deadline Jabber bot.  We had some architectural problems with it that needed fixing, but it's been solid for a few weeks now so I though it was time for an update.

h3. Editing Deadlines

Jabber now supports deadline editing:

* <code>set due id my due date</code> -- set the due date for a deadline
* <code>set description id my description</code> -- set the description

For example:

<pre>
set due 39147 next week
set due 39147 19:30
set description 39147 defeat Zod
</pre>

<p></p>

h3. Time Zones

You can now set and view your time zone.  This is really handy if you go on holiday and only have access to the Jabber interface.  It works like this:

* <code>time</code> -- view your time and zone
* <code>set zone city</code> -- set the time zone to the "city"

At the moment there's no way to view or search the cities we support -- it uses the same list as appears on the settings page on the web site.

For example:

<pre>
set zone London
set zone Paris
</pre>
