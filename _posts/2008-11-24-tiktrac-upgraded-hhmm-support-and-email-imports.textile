"Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com has just been upgraded:

* Email imports are now supported
* HH:MM can now be displayed as well as typed in (switch to it by editing a time sheet)
* The login form looks nicer
* Minor browser bug fixes (Firefox/IE both improved)

Email imports are incredibly useful if you'd like to schedule regular imports from a back office system.  Set them up like this:

* Each sheet has a unique email address, click "Import" on a time sheet to view the address
* Import a CSV file the usual way, but instead of saving the import select "Set as Email Template"
* The sheet is now ready to accept emails
* Send an email to this address with an attached CSV file to import
