Deadline now has keyboard shortcuts!  I designed them a little bit like Gmail and Google Reader, so they should be familiar to most of you.

They need to be turned on to work:

# Click *Settings* underneath the Deadline logo
# Click the *Appearance* tab
# Click the checkbox and press *Apply*

Here's the page you should see with the option:

There's a new panel in "Help":http://deadlineapp.com/help with all the shortcuts:

# j/k move up and down the deadline list
# y marks as done
# Return selects the date field
# Tab moves to the description field
# Esc cancels editing
