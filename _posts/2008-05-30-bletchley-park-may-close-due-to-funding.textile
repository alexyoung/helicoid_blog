From the BBC's article, "Code centre 'in financial crisis'":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7426310.stm:

bq. Simon Greenish, director of Bletchley Park Trust, said: "The site is unique and one of the most important remaining from World War II.
"We have exciting plans to develop the park and save it for future generations. The more visitors we have helps us to realise these plans."

As a British software developer I find this saddening, since stories of the efforts at Bletchley Park (partly due to Neal Stephenson's depiction in _Cryptonomicon_) are partly what inspired me to get into programming.

Perhaps I'll organise a big Helicoid visit to help!
