I've just rolled out an update to "Helipad":http://helipadapp.com/ that adds an *archive feature*.

Documents can now be archived, which makes them read-only and invisible to applications that sync with Helipad.  If you've got hundreds of documents, you can now archive the ones you no-longer care about to improve sync performance.

This adds the following menu items:

* The _File_ menu now has _Archive_, _Unarchive_, and _Open Archive_
* Clicking _Archive_ will archive a document, and when a document is archived it can be removed from the archive with _Unarchive_
* Clicking _Open Archive_ will show a list of archived documents

The updated menu looks like this:

The _File_ _Open_ menu item has an _Archive_ column with checkboxes that allows quick editing of archived documents:

An archived document looks very similar to a normal document, except it doesn't have a Save button:
