<a href="http://gabriel.gironda.org/articles/2006/02/08/using-helpers-inside-a-controller">Using helpers inside a controller</a> - for when you must pluralize() but dont want to mess with the controller namespace.

<a href="http://gabriel.gironda.org/articles/2006/02/06/yet-more-formhelper-caveats-annoyances-and-the-fixes">A few fixes to some FormHelper bugs</a> - need to use a form with get rather than post and find checkbox weirdness happening? fixed!

<a href="http://gabriel.gironda.org/articles/2006/02/03/registered-for-railsconf-and-overwrite_params-fix">RailsConf and another patch</a> - speaking of poor neglected get parameters, here's the reason why they might not be working properly.
