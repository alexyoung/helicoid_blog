<a href="http://multitap.net">Multitap.net</a>'s source has just reached a milestone: revision 100.  This contains new features and improvements which we hope to launch before Christmas:

* Add people to a friends list to help keep track of friends
* Friendlier date formatting
* Consistency improvements to the design across the site

One of these features was suggested to us to a user of the site.  If you wish to request features, you can use the <a href="http://multitap.net/contact">contact form</a> on the site, or post comments to this weblog.
