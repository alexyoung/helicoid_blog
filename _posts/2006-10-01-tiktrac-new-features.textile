We're always tweaking Tiktrac, and we welcome any ideas you have in "our forum":http://forums.helicoid.net.  One thing people often ask for is a timer, so Tiktrac can count the minutes for you as you work.  So I took it upon myself to dedicate the entire weekend to adding this feature.

Tasks on the homepage and on sheets now have a play/pause button:

Once a task has been completed, a little tick is displayed:

While I was there, I improved the sheet configuration, based on forum suggestions.  You can now select which fields you want displayed in a sheet:

This can be useful for people who don't want the 'ref' field, or when you're tracking a time for a project that only has one person and don't require the 'who' field.

As you might have guessed, there's a lot of cross-polination across our projects.  Tiktrac will receive more updates in the near future based on work we've done on Bugtagger and Ebiwrite.

And now, if you don't mind, I'm going to try and enjoy the last remnants of the weekend before I have to start work on something else!
