Even though we use "Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net for our notes and to-do lists, I still think you can't beat a good paper notebook.  It's hard to hunt down something unique, but we recently found "Unfinished and Unpublished":http://www.studiomatador.com/home.htm -- a limited-edition collection of very special notebooks created by a collaboration between "StudioMatador":http://www.studiomatador.com and several international artists and designers.  The Isis&amp;Pluto cover is particularly inspired.
