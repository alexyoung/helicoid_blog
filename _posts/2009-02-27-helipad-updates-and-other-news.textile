We rolled out a few minor changes to "Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net this week:

* Tags on the dashboard page can be hidden
* The space usage indicator has been removed
* Helipad can now be reached at "helipadapp.com":http://helipadapp.com

We decided to drop the space limitation because we're now selling "Helipad iPhone":http://blog.helicoid.net/articles/2009/02/10/helipad_iphone_app_now_available.

h3. Coming soon

* "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com will be moving from minutes to seconds internally, this means the timers will be more intuitive
* We're also working on a configurable dashboard for Tiktrac
* "Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com iPhone is in development
* Deadline SMS will continue to be free for a while because the SMS traffic is relatively low, so try it while it's free!
