Later this week we'll be updating Deadline with the following upgrades:

* New reminder system - this will reduce server load and allow us to add some clever new features
* Reminder previews - when editing your reminder settings you'll be able to view a table of reminders to easily see what the settings do
* Additional reminders (minutes) - you'll be able to set days, hours and minutes for additional reminders (thanks _jrk_)
* Jabber bot - the IM bot will work properly with Jabber (it'll have a new account name)
* More date parsing improvements (especially for phrases including the word "today") (thanks _Dougal_)

These updates are still being tested but we'll let you know when they're deployed.

*Update*: We've just deployed these changes to our servers.  Note that you should switch to using <a href="xmpp:talk@deadlineapp.com">talk@deadlineapp.com</a> for IM.
