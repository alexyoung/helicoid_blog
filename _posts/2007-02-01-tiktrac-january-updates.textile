Some of you reported issues with the task timer in "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com.  I've been working on getting this right for the last month, and along the way we've made quite a few improvements to Tiktrac:

* The play/pause timer buttons work the same way as iTunes
* The dynamic elements of the interface (including the timers) have been fully tested in Opera 9, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2 and Safari 2 (please blame Kev or Yuka if we've missed anything)
* Visual cues have been added when the timers are started and stopped:

* Visual cues have also been added when a task is completed:

* Buttons that change 'views' automatically retain their setting:

* The reports section looks slightly more awesome
* The graphs on the reports section are now white so they're now more printer-friendly
* Bug fixes for: mobile interface, XML data exports, sheet archival

Since I'm the lead engineer here, I'm privy to the internal changes that have happened for this release.  And they're pretty serious: Tiktrac is now rapidly approaching the long-awaited "live" release.
