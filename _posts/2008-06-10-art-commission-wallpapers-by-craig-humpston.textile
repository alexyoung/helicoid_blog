Sick of your desktop wallpaper?  Scrap it and try one of these designs!  These wonderful illustrations were commissioned by us and produced by Craig Humpston (also known online as ging_inferior).  Craig's an artist and VJ based in Nottingham, England.

Look how awesome they look on a real desktop:

If you're an artist, illustrator or designer and you'd like to contact us about commissions or working on any of our web applications, please use our "contact form":http://helicoid.net/contact/!  We pay well and if you're based around London we'll be sure to buy you a few beers too!
