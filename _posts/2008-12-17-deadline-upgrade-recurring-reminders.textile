"Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com has been upgraded:

* Support for recurring reminders has been added with documentation in the _Help_ section
* The last email reminder can now be set as "important" (this should show up in Gmail, Outlook, Apple's Mail and Thunderbird)

h3. Writing recurring events that Deadline can understand

Write a date with the word "every" to denote a recurring event.  Once the deadline's date has been reached it will be automatically rescheduled.

For example:

* Alex's birthday *every* January 21st
* Art lesson every Monday morning
* English lesson every 4pm

Recurring reminders are indicated with an icon:

Currently there's no way to manually set an event as recurring.
