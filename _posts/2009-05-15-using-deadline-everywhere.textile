h3. Mobile

Visit /mob to access Deadline's cut-down mobile version: "deadlineapp.com/mob":http://deadlineapp.com/mob/

h3. SMS

We've had strong feedback from the people on the closed SMS beta, so we'll roll this out with payment plans soon.  "Contact us":http://helicoid.net/contact if you want to try it for free until that happens.

h3. Email

Did you know you can email reminders to Deadline?  Click <strong>Help, Email</strong>  Input to get your customised email address.  It's handy to add this to your computer and phone address books so you can quickly email Deadline wherever you are.

h3. Jabber/Gtalk

I've recently been working on making the Deadline Jabber/Gtalk bots respond faster, and they're working better than ever now.  You can add talk@deadlineapp.com or deadline@helicoid.net (for Google Hosted Gtalk) to your buddy lists to talk to Deadline.  It'll send you reminders and also let you schedule and search them.

h3. Fluid

Deadline is designed to work with "Fluid":http://fluidapp.com/.  For more information on using site-specific browsers with Deadline, visit "deadlineapp.com/ssb":http://deadlineapp.com/ssb

h3. Mozilla Ubiquity

If you're a fan of "Ubiquity":https://ubiquity.mozilla.com/, check out our "Deadline Ubiquity scripts":http://deadlineapp.com/ubiquity.  This allows you to schedule and search reminders from within Firefox.

h3. API

Deadline also has an "XML API":http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/482ae365 so you can make your own applications with it.  I'm currently building an iPhone app that uses it.
