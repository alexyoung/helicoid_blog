We're in the final stages of testing <a href="http://tiktrac.com/">Tiktrac</a>, our timesheets software.

For a long time, we have had to put up with spreadsheets for timesheets.  So one of us initiated a project to create a simple Ajax time management application, and then we both evolved it into something quite sophisticated.

We have also updated the <a href="http://tiktrac.com/">Tiktrac homepage</a>, so you can read more about the features it will launch with.
