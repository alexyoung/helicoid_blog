"Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com has been updated.  We've added:

* The API, so developers can extract data and integrate Tiktrac with other applications
* A cleaner sheet page, allowing you to edit the sheet without leaving the page
* A search box on most pages, to help you find tasks easily
* A sheet list that appears on the sheet page, to allow you to navigate between your sheets more easily
* A cleaner login page
* A new reports type, that gives you a general overview of all your tasks and sheets when you visit the reports section

Let us know what you think!
