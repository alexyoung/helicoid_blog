"Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com has just been updated with  some minor bug fixes (thanks for the bug reports Tom and Oriol).  We've also implement something to help you with billing clients.

Sheets can now be set up to include a "paid" field.  It works a little bit like the "done" field.

Additionally, a new table will appear on the Dashboard to display an overview of outstanding work.

There's more about this feature on Tiktrac's help page.

We hope this will make your billing process a little bit smoother.  It's already proven useful to us!
