"Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com now supports SMS (text messages).  The feature is currently available as a trial while we estimate costs.  To get on the trial, see the *SMS page* in *Deadline Settings* for more details.

h3. Notes on Deadline's SMS support

* The trial is free, but SMS support will be a paid feature in the future.  This is because sending an SMS costs money and Deadline is currently a free service.  We may subsidise SMS using context-sensitive adverts in the future.
* Two-way SMS may be available in the future, we're still looking into costs and international support issues.
* You're currently limited to 10 messages a day.  This number may change depending on popularity and costs.

h3. Other improvements in this upgrade

* Deadline now supports "Fluid":http://deadlineapp.com/ssb
* Deadline now supports "Mozilla Ubiquity":http://deadlineapp.com/ubiquity
* Setting "Remember me" during login should always work now
* The settings page has been tidied up, with some secondary navigation to help you find things
* We fixed a bug in Jabber
