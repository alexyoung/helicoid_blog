There's a new plugin that you can find more <a href="http://gabriel.gironda.org/articles/2006/03/09/acts_as_urlnameable-released">info about here</a>. It hopefully fulfils all your url naming needs, it filled ours! We are planning on soon having a public SVN repository which should hold some interesting things.
