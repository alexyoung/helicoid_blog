We've been working on making "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com "live" since April.  During this time, we've held off updates while we've gone through the process of setting up our billing system.

This took slightly longer than we anticipated, but fortunately we've been able put a lot of effort into Tiktrac during this time.

Before the end of the month, we'll be deploying:

* Time zone support
* Monthly "targets" -- something contractors will appreciate
* SSL -- Tiktrac will work over secure connections
* A more consistent, dynamic and refined interface
* Interface and usability tweaks for every feature
* Inline help: !http://assets.helicoid.net/images/blogs/inline_help.png!
* Bug fixes to improve reliability and speed
* 100% test code coverage -- all of our code is now covered by tests

h3. Payments

* Payments for Tiktrac will be made with credit card
* You will be billed monthly
* We will calculate tax where companies are based in the UK and EU, else you are expected to pay your own local taxes
* We will not store your creditcard details on our servers, thus maintaining a high level of security
* A grace period of several days will be applied for us to receive payments
* Benefits for referrals are currently in development

h3. Beta testers

Anyone currently using the service is considered a beta tester.  You will receive 2 months free premium-level service.

h3. Price

Price plans will be formally announced when Tiktrac goes live, but you can expect the average plan to cost around Â£10 a month (and this will be sufficient to cover an SME.)

h3. Want to work with us?

We've learned a lot in creating, developing and maintaining successful web applications.  If you'd like to utilise our skills and experience, "we'd love to hear from you!":http://helicoid.net/contact/
