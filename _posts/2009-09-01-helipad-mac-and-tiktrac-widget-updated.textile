"Helipad Mac":http://helipadapp.com/mac.html has been updated.  This update makes it work better in Snow Leopard, and makes it sync when you press cmd-s.  It's a free download by the way!

"Tiktrac's Dashboard Widget":http://tiktrac.com/widgets has also been upgraded.  This version fixes a few bugs:

* When creating tasks, the checkbox state will be saved correctly
* It now stops you from attempting to add multiple tasks in one go (this might be added in a future update though)
* I'm still working on odd timer glitches
