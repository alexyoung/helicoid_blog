Helipad now allows you to export your documents.  You can export one big XML file, containing the text along with the tags and other information, or a zip file containing exported documents as text files.

Here's an image that illustrates the process:

To use this feature, select 'your account' and look for 'Export your documents' at the bottom of the page.

You could use this to export your notes and work on them offline in your favourite text editor!
