As part of our customer service strategy, we've just set up our "service status page":http://status.helicoid.net

It's hosted away from our applications (in the US instead of the UK), so chances are it will be up in the event of any connectivity issues with our main servers.

If you rely on "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com or "Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net, why not bookmark it?
