"Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com is our latest app: a new take on the web calendar.  It uses natural language parsing to interpret events you write in plain English.  Searching is also intelligent: typing "next week" shows all your events for next week, whereas "meet kev" will look for those keywords.

Deadline works with *Jabber/Gtalk*: it sends reminders and also allows you to delete, delay and hide events through your IM client.

It also *accepts and sends email*.  That means if your mobile phone supports email or MMS you can get and set reminders anywhere.  There's also a mobile interface too just like the rest of Helicoid's projects.

If it can't understand the date and time you've typed in, it'll prompt you to enter one with a form like this:

Deadline is the second application to use "Helicoid":http://helicoid.net's auth server, which means if you have a "Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net it's single sign-on!

Deadline looks very different to our other web applications.  There's barely any navigation and no footer.  When you hover the logo minimal navigation appears.  I really wanted to make something that looked graphical, almost like an album cover: big helvetica fonts, bold colours, with an emphasis on your data over application chrome.

Accounts are free and signup is quick (remember you can just login if you use Helipad).  If you'd like to know about the technical stuff, or upcoming API details, post a comment and I'll get back to you.

There's also more details here: http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/93f5a1ce

*Updates*

* 13th November: Cleaned up help text interface, fixed a typo on the homepage
* 13th November: Improved IM and email help (inline help on the Settings page, complete with screenshots)
* 12th November: Acknowledged that if you have a Helipad account and try to reset your password on Deadline it doesn't work if you haven't used Deadline before.  This will be fixed soon.
