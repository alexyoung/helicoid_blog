"Think":http://freeverse.com/apps/app/?id=7013&view=overview (for Mac OS X) lets you focus on what you're doing by creating a configurable backdrop behind a single application.  It shows you a list of running applications (in the same style as pressing cmd-tab).  It doesn't do much more than that!

One of the touches I like about it is it shows the currently selected application's icon in the Dock.  Of course, if you really need to focus hiding the dock might be a good idea.

My current technique for 100% focus on work is simply quitting my email client.  That pretty much frees up my brain for as long as I need to concentrate.
