This is a small example of what you can do with the Tiktrac API.  We've created a script that we use with our subversion scripts for checking source code into our repositories.

Whenever we edit code on our projects, we can easily log the time we spent at the same time using a slightly modified version of this script.  Download it and hack it to your delight.
