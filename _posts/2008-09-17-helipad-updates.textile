We upgraded "Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net today.  Changes include:

* If you click _Preview_ you can now export documents as PDF (in addition to HTML)
* The PDF functionality is very simple right now, but I've got some good ideas on how to extend it in the future
* The homepage has been redesigned
* We fixed a bug a few people reported to do with document indexing
* The API has been updated so tags are easier to specify

The new homepage features the "vine" graphics we use on Helicoid.net:

Here's the "old homepage":http://www.flickr.com/photos/helicoid/2865929770/ for reference.

The most exciting thing about this Helipad upgrade is that Helipad now uses our *internal authentication server*.  We'll be launching two new services over the next few months that will be single sign-on for Helipad users.
