Helipad's PDF generator now supports **UTF-8** characters.  The previous PDF exporter was a temporary solution that just worked on plain old-fashioned ASCII text, but this upgraded version should perform a lot better.

It's still aimed at generating simple text documents, but if English isn't your first language then you should find it generates documents in your language.
