In our "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com live announcement we promised editable costs.  Over the last week we've been working on this, but added and improved so much more along the way.

h3. Editable costs and tax

* It's now possible to set the cost calculation per sheet
* The cost calculations available are: manual (editable costs), hourly rate and hourly rate + tax
* Tax can be entered as a percentage and defaults to 17.5%

When using manually entered costs, the cost field appears next to the duration field:

Notice that this makes it possible to add a sheet dedicated to expenses.  Here's how we've set up expenses ourselves:

h3. Reports improvements

* Reports now all use the same date direction
* Line charts have been added for "busy" reports, making their appearance cleaner
* The "People" graphs are now generated much faster
* The "Overview" reports have been cleaned up

h3. Help system upgrade

We now have a more flexible and friendly help system.  Click on "help" at the top of the page to check it out.  It prints out nicely too!

h3. Other changes

* If you've added your own icon, it will now be much larger
* Changing a sheet's ordering (by clicking on the headers) is remembered after login!
