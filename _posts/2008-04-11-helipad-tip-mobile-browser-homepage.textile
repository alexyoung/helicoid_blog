Kev (our sysadmin and morale officer) uses "Helipad mobile":http://pad.helicoid.net/mob in a unique way: he sets a tag's page as his mobile browser's homepage.  This means he can quickly access documents suitable for his phone.

In his case he uses documents tagged with "gtd" so he can easily keep track of todo lists.  I thought it might be useful to have an "@mobile" tag for documents you generally want to see on the move.

We're still working on the Helipad upgrade and Mac version, they're almost ready! (Mac version needs serious testing to get synchronisation safe, upgrade needs more IE testing in Windows.)
