"Tiktrac's":http://tiktrac.com/ graphs, which we've been using for about 4 years, have been replaced.  The new ones should look cleaner and improve page loading times.  This update also has several small improvements:

* Printed reports will look better
* Sheet names will now always be escaped ("mheine" found unescaped ampersands)
* Visiting <em>http://youraccount.tiktrac.com/export</em> can be used as a shortcut for exporting your data
* Similarly, You can now leave the service by visiting "/cancel" from your account's URL
* The login page has been tidied up

We're working to standardise "support" related URLs like /cancel and /export across our apps.
