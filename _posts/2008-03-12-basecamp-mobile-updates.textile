I've been working on updating "Basecamp Mobile":http://basecamp.helicoid.net to try and solve the login issues some users have reported.

* "basecamp.helicoid.net":http://basecamp.helicoid.net is now running on a faster server
* I've updated legacy code and moved it to Rails 2
* The public code repository has been updated: "http://code.helicoid.net/svn/applications/bcm/":http://code.helicoid.net/svn/applications/bcm/

Many thanks to "ash" for his helpful suggestions.
