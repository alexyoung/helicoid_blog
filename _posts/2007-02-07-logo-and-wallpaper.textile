I've taken the liberty of posting a preview of our new logo:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helicoid/382737934/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/382737934_10eb8eef51_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Helicoid wallpaper" /></a>

We've discussed logos internally for months, partly because I'm obsessed with them.  I wanted to incorporate Barbara Hepworth's "Helicoid in Sphere":http://www.hh-h.com/hepworth-helicoid%20in%20sphere.htm into the design, since I've always loved her sculptures.  I also wanted something "classic"; I favour logos that work well in two colours, and use simple shapes.  Mont Blanc, Apple, Woolmark and the Target logos are all great examples.

Kev agreed with most of this, although he disliked any attempt to use a Serif font.  Yuka wanted a cute creature involved, but ultimately was the one who picked the abstracted helicoid you see above.

We haven't ordered any prints of letterheads, business cards and "with complements" yet, so if you have any strong opinion on our choice let us know!
