"Helicoid ID":http://id.helicoid.net is our new account management mini app.  Here are the basics:

* Sign in with your Helipad/Deadline account details -- this is your *Helicoid ID*
* It shows you the Helicoid services that you currently use, and other available services
* It allows you to change your personal details across supported applications
* News and updates about apps will be displayed here
* It currently only supports "Helipad":http://helipadapp.com and "Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com
* It will ease the transition of other services into our shared authentication system ("Ebiwrite":http://ebiwrite.com is next)
* It will host centralised billing for future paid versions of Helipad, Deadline (as well as Tiktrac and Ebiwrite)
* We'll migrate "the forum":http://forum.helicoid.net eventually as well

Here's what it looks like:
