"Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net supports plugins and themes through add-ons.  To view available add-ons, click the link at the top right of Helipad.

Installing an add-on adds a document to your account that contains the code for the add-on.  This allows you to edit it, which is useful for customising themes.  

Add-ons can be updated to a newer version if the author updates it by clicking on _Settings_ and then _Plugins_.  You can also remove add-ons here.

If you'd like to write an add-on, we've written some documentation on the process: "Helipad add-on documentation":http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/9406837a.

Add-ons are simply an XML container that wraps JavaScript and CSS, so if you've got some basic web development experience you should be able to write an add-on.
