When we formally launched Tiktrac a month ago, we promised several new features:

* -Editable costs- Done!
* -Bigger branding logos- Done!
* -REST API (for JavaScript and widget developers)- New!
* Configurable reports with CSV exports
* Integration with our other applications

We've just finished the third planned upgrade: the REST API.  This makes it much easier for widget developers to use Tiktrac.

The rest of this post is aimed at technical readers.  If you use Tiktrac and know anyone who might be interested in writing a widget, please forward this on. (Thanks!)

The beta API currently supports:

* Fetching a list of sheets as XML or JSON
* Fetching a list of tasks for a sheet as XML or JSON
* Updating a task using XML

We've posted guidelines on how to use the API as a shared Helipad document:

"http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/250fcab4":http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/250fcab4

The documentation includes an example JavaScript class that I wrote over a few drinks last night.  It's not bullet proof, but it should get you widget hackers started!
