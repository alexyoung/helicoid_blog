Deadline's repeating events were handled in a slightly confusing manner.  The old behaviour was to create a new deadline each time the reminder date came around.  That was fine, except the behaviour of marking that event as 'Done' wasn't very clear.

I've changed it to update the repeating deadline's date, instead of generating a new one.  A reminder will still get created each time the date rolls around.  Instead of showing a 'Done' button, repeating deadlines will show 'Stop' -- _stop_ receiving future reminders and hide the deadline.  This makes it a little bit clearer than before.

If anything about repeating deadlines still seems confusing, message us on Twitter, "@helicoid":http://twitter.com/helicoid or comment on this post.
