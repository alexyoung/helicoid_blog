This tip applies to all of our applications.  When you see a letter underlined in a link or form button, this means there is an available keyboard shortcut.  This type of keyboard shortcut is called an "access key".

Different browsers handle these keyboard shortcuts in different ways.  In Safari (Mac OS), I press ctrl-letter.  In Internet Explorer, I'd press alt-letter.  Check your preferred browser's manual to see how it handles access keys.

To open up "Add a new task", I'd press ctrl-a.  The task save form also has an access key, so I can press ctrl-s to save.

"Helipad":http://pad.helicoid.net has access keys on common operations, like new document and save document.  You can even get straight into the handy search bar by pressing ctrl/alt-f:
