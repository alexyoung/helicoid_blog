Tiktrac's times are now *internally stored in seconds*.  This means the timer is much more intuitive.  We also took this opportunity to make the timer look more like a clock:

The task entry form now displays the end date when you set the task as completed, which saves a few seconds when inputting lots of tasks.

We've also made the currently selected sheet clearer in the right-hand navigation.

There's also a new manage screen which allows you to add or configure clients and sheets -- administrators will see a *Manage* tab at the top of each page.  I decided to add this page because we want to remove the right-hand sheet navigation to replace it with something that uses less space in the future.

The seconds upgrade was actually a difficult thing to do, but it's resulted in cleaner code internally.  That frees us up to implement new features soon (upgraded dashboard, navigation and invoicing).
