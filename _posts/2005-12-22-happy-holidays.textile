First of all, happy holidays to everyone who uses our sites!

Secondly, <a href="http://multitap.net">Multitap.net</a> has been upgraded.  As well as a few consistency improvements to various features, we've added a 'friends' system which allows you to add users to a friends list.  This will be extended in 2006 to provide more sophisticated features, but the bare minimum is there.

This allows me, for example, to keep track of what <a href="http://multitap.net/screenshot/user/6">Kev</a> is posting to the site.  I like to keep an eye on what images he's posted, so he's been added to my friends list.

To support this feature, we will be improving the 'user page' to include a brief overview of their friends' screenshots.  All will come in due time...  And, please share your ideas for the site with us!
