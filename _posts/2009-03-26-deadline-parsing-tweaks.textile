"Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com now works with relative time:

* Visit estate agent in 3 hours
* Deploy Deadline upgrade in 2 days
* Plan wedding next month

This update includes bug fixes, especially relating to Deadline's recognition of ranges of time for repeating dates.

I've also been working on making Deadline's email interface more user-friendly.  It's not quite ready yet, but it's almost there.
