"Deadline":http://deadlineapp.com has been updated with some interface tweaks:

* A balloon will pop up as you hover over dates to show more text
* The background image is now fixed
* There's now an option in *Appearance/Settings* that will let you turn off the hover fading effect

The date details balloon looks like this:

It shows you the day name and time until the event.  If you've specified a time for your event it'll display the time as well.
