Our server hosting company are performing maintenance next week.  They're moving our servers, which means they'll definitely be offline for a few minutes.  Here's the information they sent us:

bq. *Date of Work*: 17th - 18th February 2009
   *Maintenance Window*: 19:00 through 04:00
   *Outage per Host*: Up to two hours, likely 30 minutes

We apologise for any inconvenience this might cause, and we will backup your data externally to ensure it's safe.  This is the first outage we've had from "Bytemark Hosting":http://www.bytemark.co.uk/ for 3 years, the last (30 second) outage we had was where we prepared for this downtime.
