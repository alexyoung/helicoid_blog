Using "Tiktrac":http://tiktrac.com for price plans other than free will require subscription payments starting today.

We allowed free usage for a grace period after beta testing, but unfortunately this is about to end.

If you do not pay, your account will be locked.  However, you will still be able to access the data export page and save your data as XML.

To read more about billing or make a payment, navigate to <strong>Tiktrac settings</strong> (the link at the top-right of the page), then *Billing*.
