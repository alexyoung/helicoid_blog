We updated Tiktrac this morning with a neater project selector.  This makes managing lots of sheets much easier for those of you with large accounts.

During the update we ran into unexpected server issues and had to perform emergency maintenance - this meant we had to take Helipad, Tiktrac and Ebiwrite down to fix the issue (they're all on the same servers).

During this maintenance we posted updates to Twitter and our "service status":http://status.helicoid.net/ page.  It's worth bookmarking out status page if you rely on our services, because we post the times and dates of any planned maintenance:

"http://status.helicoid.net/":http://status.helicoid.net/

Our twitter account can be found here:

I also occasionally post technical details about what we're working on to Twitter, so check it out!
