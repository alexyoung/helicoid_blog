Do you ever wish you could quickly write a note, to-do list, or organise a bunch of ideas on your computer... but access them anywhere?  Do you find uploading documents to web sites annoying, and just want to write?

If so, you'll love <a href="http://pad.helicoid.net/">Helipad</a>.  This is our latest project, designed to be the perfect web-based companion to your tattered and beloved notepad.

Helipad is an online notepad.  It has several features that make it unique:

* Notes can be organised with tags, and you can give tags colours to easily find them
* There's an unobtrusive auto-save that helps protect you from computer and browser crashes
* You can read and write notes on your phone with your phone's web browser
* <a href="http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/6313d317">There's an API</a>, so developers can use their applications with it
* <a href="http://pad.helicoid.net/document/public/9406837a">There's an add-on API</a>, so developers can create themes and plugins

Helipad lets you customise it to the extreme.  It really is your own.  You can radically change the interface, or add your own features. 

h3. Coloured tags

Colour your tags with sliders:

h3. The future

Helipad's brilliantly simple, and depending on the outcome of beta testing we wish to extend it with:

* Collaboration and versioning
* PDF exports
* Drag and drop document re-ordering

h3. One last thing...

Everyone that works for Helicoid loves macs, so I've been bullied into writing a mac version of Helipad.  It downloads all your documents so you can work on your Helipad documents off-line.

Here's a screenshot:

This might not be completed for several months, but we'll let you know as soon as it's ready!
