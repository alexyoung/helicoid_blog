I've just finished updating <a href="http://pad.helicoid.net">Helipad</a> with some recent changes.  I've also released the to-do list plugin, which I'm still working on but is now in a somewhat usable state.  It's also a great example of what you can do with plugins.

h3. Helipad internal changes

Many of these changes came about through our bug reporting system, <a href="http://bugtagger.com">Bugtagger</a>.  So thanks for the bug reports!

* Fixed a little bug where the tag help link on the edit broke
* Improved printing: margins are bigger and links appear alongside the original URL
* Added CSS to plugins, so your plugins can include their own styles
* Made changelogs in plugins always appear in the same order
* Improved usability of the mobile area
* Made autosave more robust

h3. To-do list plugin

To enable to plugin:

# Navigate to 'add-ons' and find it
# Click 'install'
# Tag a new document with 'todo'
# Viewing the document on the preview page
# Say, "yes, I want to use this plugin"

Now you'll have a great dynamic to-do list on your Preview page, like this:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helicoid/322090791/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/134/322090791_dc9a7374a9_m.jpg" width="240" height="181" alt="todo_list_in_preview" /></a>

And the edit page is still readable:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helicoid/322090790/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/144/322090790_6c515ad7de_m.jpg" width="240" height="181" alt="todo_list_in_edit" /></a>

The to-do list plugin actually modifies your documents to ensure they can still be edited in a text-friendly way.  This means you can still use the document on your phone, or perform drastic editing operations that the plugin doesn't provide.

h3. Tongue-in-cheek Christmas theme

I've also added a Christmas theme, replete with snowflakes and seasonal colours.  It's very silly, and I only hope it inspires somebody to do better!

Merry Christmas!
